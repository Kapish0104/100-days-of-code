Started with coding for question no. 9. Got stuck on it. 
Looked up for solutions online but still did not get any satisfactory solutions. Spent about 1 hour on this question alone. 
Then revised all the sorting algorithms.

PS: IF any of you can comeup with a good solution for question no. 9, then please explain it to me.
