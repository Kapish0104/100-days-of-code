Came up with a working solution for question 10. This took about 25 minutes of time. 
Then Saw one more solution called "Binary Search" of question 11  On leet code. 
Discussed with a friend and it took about 45 minutes just to understand the solution to that problem. 
Also this reminds me I have to revise search Algorithms.
